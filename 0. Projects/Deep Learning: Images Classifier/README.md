# Deep Learning Image Classifier

## Part 1: [train the images data and test result](https://github.com/dylan-shao/ML-DS-Udacity_Data_Scientist_Nanodegree/tree/master/0.%20Projects/Deep%20Learning:%20Images%20Classifier/Part%201)
In part 1 of this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Load and preprocess the image dataset
* Train the image classifier on your dataset
* Use the trained classifier to predict image content

## Part 2: [Building the command line application with the **argparse** module](https://github.com/dylan-shao/ML-DS-Udacity_Data_Scientist_Nanodegree/tree/master/0.%20Projects/Deep%20Learning:%20Images%20Classifier/Part2)
Now that you've built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, it's time to convert it into an application that others can use. Your application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line. For testing, you should use the checkpoint you saved in the first part.
